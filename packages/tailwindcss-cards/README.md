@casoon/tailwindcss-cards
=========================

CSS-first Tailwind v4 card layouts and interactive presets as `@utility` classes.

- Import

```
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@casoon/tailwindcss-cards";
```

- Use

```
<div class="cs-card cs-card-feature">â€¦</div>
```

- Variants
  - `motion-safe`, `motion-reduce`, `contrast-more`, `forced-colors`, `dark`, `light`

Notes
- Card presets rely on CSS variables for spacing, radius, and shadows.
- Hover/focus effects are nested per utility for small, shakeable output.
