# Modular Structure for tailwindcss-animations

## Current Structure
The animations package (1,204 lines) should be modularized for better maintainability.

## Proposed Structure
```
src/
├── index.css              # Main entry point with imports
├── categories/
│   ├── basic-animations.css      # Pulse, bounce, wiggle, shake
│   ├── entrance-animations.css   # Fade in, slide in, zoom in
│   ├── exit-animations.css       # Fade out, slide out, zoom out
│   ├── attention-animations.css  # Heartbeat, flash, tada
│   ├── rotation-animations.css   # Rotate, flip, spin
│   └── utility-animations.css    # Keyframe utilities, timing functions
└── tokens/
    └── animation-tokens.css       # Duration, easing, timing tokens
```

## Benefits of Modularization
1. **Easier Maintenance** - Each animation category in its own file
2. **Better Performance** - Selective imports for specific needs  
3. **Improved Development** - Faster navigation and editing
4. **Clear Organization** - Logical grouping of related animations
5. **Enhanced Testing** - Easier to test individual animation categories

## Implementation Notes
- The current index.css contains mixed content that could be better organized
- Animation categories would each be ~150-250 lines (manageable size)
- Import structure would maintain backward compatibility
- Build process would create the same dist.css output

## Future Enhancements
- Optional: Create animation presets/bundles (e.g., "essential", "advanced")  
- Optional: Add animation configuration utilities
- Optional: Include animation performance optimization flags
