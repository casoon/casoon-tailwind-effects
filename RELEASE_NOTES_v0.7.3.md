# Release Notes - v0.7.3

**Release Date:** September 9, 2025  
**Type:** Patch Release - CSS Quality Improvements

## 🎯 Overview

Version 0.7.3 focuses on CSS code quality improvements, validation fixes, and optimization without breaking changes. This release ensures better maintainability and reduced CSS specificity conflicts.

## ✅ Bug Fixes

### CSS Validation Issues
- **Fixed non-prefixed classes**: Ensured all CSS classes use the `cs-` prefix convention
  - `ripple-anim` → `cs-ripple-anim` in navigation package
  - `has-scroll` → `cs-has-scroll` in scroll package
- **All packages now pass CSS validation** with zero errors

## 🚀 Improvements

### CSS Optimization
- **Eliminated all `!important` declarations** from loading package (21 occurrences removed)
- **Reduced long CSS selectors** by breaking down complex `:is()` selectors into logical groups
- **Improved CSS specificity** using higher specificity selectors instead of `!important`
- **Better animation handling** in reduced motion queries using `animation-name: none`

### Code Quality
- **Enhanced maintainability** with cleaner, more readable CSS structure
- **Reduced framework conflicts** by eliminating aggressive `!important` usage
- **Better performance** with optimized selector grouping
